# 🌿 Data Complete — A Clean & Purposeful Data Repository

### About

**Data Complete** is a personal project aimed at learning, organizing, and practicing real-world data workflows — from raw collection to clean, usable datasets.
This repository reflects a journey of discipline, precision, and honesty in handling data with responsibility and clarity.

### 🧩 Objectives

* To build a structured, transparent data pipeline.
* To practice and document data cleaning, wrangling, and validation.
* To provide reusable datasets for learning analytics, machine learning, and automation.
* To cultivate ethical awareness: data is a *trust (amanah)*, not just numbers.
